# Here you can put email aliases. Here's an example:

alias Dalek e@email.com
alias cyberman e2@outlook.com
alias dravos e3@gmail.com

# When you put "Dalek" as the recipient in mutt, it will automatically direct it to e@mail.com email address.

# You can also put multiple emails under one aliases:

# alias group e@email4.com, e@email5.com, e@email6.com

# With the above alias, if you put "group" as the recipient, mutt will fill in all the emails above as the recipients.

# This is extremely useful, so take advantage of it!
