2018-05-20 16:51:21	maldridge	nope
2018-05-20 16:51:24	maldridge	there's nothing dynamic
2018-05-20 16:51:31	maldridge	it just pulls things from the index
2018-05-20 16:53:15	kimat1	index.html:48 onkeyup="if(window.voidSearch)window.voidSearch()"
2018-05-20 16:53:38	maldridge	yeah, there's some javascript, but there is no dynamic webserver as you suggest
2018-05-20 16:58:36	kimat1	do I read correctly in https://www.voidlinux.eu/assets/js/voidsearch.js:111
2018-05-20 16:58:56	kimat1	it gets https://repo.voidlinux.eu/current/ which is 8.4M

2018-05-20 21:53:49	Nilium	So it turns out parsing plists in Go is kinda phenomenally annoying
2018-05-20 21:56:53	Dirkson	Oh. Yeah, my void install is now just completely broken. The installation of the new nvidia package must have removed some bit my old kernel was relying on. Can't boot into X at all anymore.
2018-05-20 22:05:46	Nilium	Does single-user mode work?
2018-05-20 22:06:18	Nilium	Or are you otherwise able to get to a terminal?

2018-05-20 22:16:44	Dirkson	It looks like it's the clang+nvidia-dkms bug that was getting me, which appears to be a known bug.
