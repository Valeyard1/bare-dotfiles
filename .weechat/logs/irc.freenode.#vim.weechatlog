2018-05-20 22:45:45	m1n	jamessan, ok. I would hate to introduce another bot, but I think it would be awesome if there was a bot that had a login mechanism such that trusted users could add some things get repeated a lot, and also I want to add a polling thing so that people (based on their account) could add their top and 2 other favourite colorschemes and other stuff perhaps. I just want to do fun little things like that. I feel like
2018-05-20 22:45:47	m1n	two bots would be too much, though, and all of that is superflous anyway, but it would be fun and exciting, I think

2018-05-20 23:01:19	m1n	this is non-interative and I would add a lot of throttling and such. For example, you wouldn't be able to spam  votebot: best colorscheme. It would privately send someone a message saying "I said that less than one hour ago. If you keep spamming the same thing, I will ignore you for 20 minutes. Nonetheless here is the link: https://blablabla" and a lot of other things, etc, etc
2018-05-20 23:01:46	m1n	idk I will just work on a little somethin, somethin. Doesn't sound like you're enthused, but I will just hack away on another channel
