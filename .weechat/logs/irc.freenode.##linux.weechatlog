2018-05-20 21:52:56	pankaj	I am getting error in section 6.16 i.e. binutils installation. Test suite is reporting error.
2018-05-20 21:52:56	Pentode	interesting. i'm not a cpu guru but i'd wonder if there were some kind of support option that hadn't been included in the xen kernel maybe?

2018-05-20 21:55:14	Pentode	ArchNemesis, what is it about the xen kernel that makes it any different than any other, if anything?
2018-05-20 21:55:21	ArchNemesis	the closest thing i found on google was a refrence to a bug in kernel 4.9.x  on redhads bugtracker  but i have a identical server running the same kernel in another location that doesn't exhibit the problem
2018-05-20 21:55:21	Pentode	maybe just stick with a different kernel that works
